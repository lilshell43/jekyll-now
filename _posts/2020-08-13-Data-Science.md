title: What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

In my opinion, a data scientist is all about working with huge and messy data, organizing that data, using statistical models to help make business decisions and bring insights to your company. You must have domain knowledge about the subject matter and the most important thing is to be able to communicate your results. You must also be fimiliar with data science tools such as python, R, machine learning, statistics, AI, neural networks, and databases. A data scientist and statistician both use statistical concepts for their duties but data scientists will use it for finding the best model. Statisticians will use stats for finding the best fit model and to also explain the uncertainties. My goal is to become a statistician but I view myself more to becoming more of a data scientist because my job duties are heading more to that route.
