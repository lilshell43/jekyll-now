title: Reflection Blog Post
---

Go back and read your initial blog post where we discussed data science as well as your blog post about your thoughts on R.  Write a reflection post about:

• What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do

What changed about my thoughts on being a data scientist is the small amount of modeling that's actually required. Prepping the data and being able the implement the business solution were the primary chunks of the job duty. I think it's interesting because I look at many job requirements for data scientists, and it's different for many companies. Some care a lot about the statistics/modeling, software engineering, programming, domain knowledge, data visualizations, etc. This is the one thing I fear about being a data scientist. Your skills could be valued in one company, but not in another one. 

• What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

R has given me a headache in all the assignments I have did in this class. But I have got a lot better with the programming language and want to learn more of its capalities. Having R in my repertoire would be great and keeps my resume competitive for moving forward in my career. I still prefer SAS over R and plan to dive into python also. For R, I really like the shiny apps and seeing the more advanced reports online sparked my curiousity with it. 

• What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

For my work duties, I mostly use Tableau and Tableau Prep for data visualization. The good thing about this tool is that you could implement R scripts into it. With the modeling capabilities that R contains, I really want to help my company with forecasting and predictive analytics. The docker tool that we used also caught my interest and we have some big data engineering roles at my company that use it. This could be a possible career switch for me.
