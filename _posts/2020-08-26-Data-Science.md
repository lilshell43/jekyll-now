title: Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

My thoughts are that R is a very awkward and different programmimng language versus what I'm used to. The syntax doesn't have a theme for me to help with memorizing. I used SAS and VBA programming before and SAS was easy to get the hang of. I miss how SAS was mainly about the Proc Steps, Data Steps, and Run Step. I consider R very difficult to learn because there's 5 different ways to do the same thing and the functions can be tricky. I really like all the different things you can do with it and I plan to continue to learn it after this course to help me with my projects at work and add another tool to my belt.
