• Explaining what you did in the project and any findings you made

For my analyses, since I don't know anything about the NHL, I looked at the teams with the most wins, losses, and games played to get a feel for what the dominant franchises were. Montreal Canadiens were the best team overall to me. They were in the top 5 win count of all time and they weren't on the list for most losses. Since I live in Tampa, I also looked up the Tampa Bay Lightning to learn more about the team. There's many center positions on the team after I looked into the frequencies. The team has a winning percentage of 61% so they're winning more games than losing. Maybe I should go watch them play in real life.  They are in the Atlantic Division so I looked at all 8 teams in that conference and they're wins. It seems the most successful teams win by outshooting their opponent, hence the upward trend that was reporded on the scatterplot.

• You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:

 – what would you do differently in approaching the project?
 
 – what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?
 
 – what are your big take-aways for future projects?
 

This project was a lot harder than I thought and R is very tricky. I use tableau for data visualization in my current role and it's a drag and drop interface. So doing things such as formatting the reports were difficult for me. What I would do differently is maybe focus on the data more to get a clear understating. There's so many tables/endpoints and for most fields, I didn't know what they meant. My main focus were around 5-7 columns. Another difficult obstacle for me is I still struggle with understanding datasources. When I connected to some endpoints, they had lists, matrixes, etc. nested inside them. I'm not used to this so filtering out what I needed was very challenging. I wanted to do an time series analysis on all the Atlantic Division teams for the last 20 years but this was too difficult for me. My big take away for future projects is to really understand and get a feel for the data.
