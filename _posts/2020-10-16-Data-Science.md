At first, I thought this project would be easier than the first,, but I found myself getting stuck at setting up the models and automation. In conclusion, this was a very mind challenging project and I learned a lot from it.

• what would you do differently?

If I were to do something differently, it would be to try out other modeling methods.

• what was the most difficult part for you?

The most diffucult part of the project was getting the automation to work. I looked at the class videos, notes, and reasearched online for hours but I'm still not confident in the way I did it.

• what are your big take-aways from this project?

When it comes to automating report, I prefer to use tableau, excel, or power bi over R. Maybe I'm still not used to it but I don't think it's very user friendly.
